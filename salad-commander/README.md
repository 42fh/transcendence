Relevance: Server Side Pong streaming the position of an object (e.g. ball/paddle)

This demonstrates how a (game) server can receive the position of an object (here a "wand" emoji) from one client and send it (with low latency) to another device (that updates the position of the "leafy-green" emoji accordingly). 

Try it out (up to 50sec cold start delay) by opening the

receiver (1) on one device/tab and the sender (2) on another and move the wand using your finger (touch screen) or cursor to see it move on the receiver
