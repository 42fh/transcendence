# Multiplayer Pong (Transcendence)

=======

**Transcendence** is the final project of the core curriculum at 42 School. After projects including developing a shell in C and a web server in C++, we are now expected to "transcend" with a full-stack, online multiplayer **Pong** game, which is on par with final projects of web-dev specific bootcamps. Since it's 42, we're required to build the frontend in Vanilla JS, with the option of enhancing it with Bootstrap.
